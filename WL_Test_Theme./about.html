                    At a time when cars from Europe became something controversial and unreliable, and the stability of the Ukrainian market was inadequate prices, there was a need to solve this problem. Solutions for everyone who needs a car.
                    
                    We chose America because, despite the supposedly difficult delivery, cars from the USA are worth buying and bringing to Ukraine. Better equipment, transparent history, no twisted mileage and the price is 20-30% lower than in Ukraine. The advantages are more than enough to get rid of the thought of buying a battered and painted car on the local market.
                
                    First, we checked it ourselves — and we still only drive cars from America. Personal experience and the experience of already hundreds of customers allows us to say that car importation from the USA is the best option for Ukraine.
